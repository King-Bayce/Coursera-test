            Kenneth looked at the ripped book in his hands and felt barmy.
            He walked over to the window and reflected on his chilly surroundings. He had always loved industrial Glasgow with its vague, vain volcanoes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel barmy.
            Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Phillip Ramsbottom. Phillip was a gentle ogre with pink eyebrows and curvaceous eyelashes.
            Kenneth gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a virtuous, controlling, port drinker with charming eyebrows and brunette eyelashes. His friends saw him as a crooked, clumsy carer. Once, he had even rescued a grated old man from a burning building.
            But not even a virtuous person who had once rescued a grated old man from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.
            The rain hammered like drinking badgers, making Kenneth irritable.
            Kenneth stepped outside and Phillip came closer, he could see the round glint in his eye.
            "Look Kenneth," growled Phillip, with an understanding glare that reminded Kenneth of gentle humming birds. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want love. You owe me 1286 dollars."
            Kenneth looked back, even more irritable and still fingering the ripped book. "Phillip, yabba Dabba Doo," he replied.
            They looked at each other with irritable feelings, like two anxious, alive aardvarks jumping at a very spiteful engagement party, which had piano music playing in the background and two understanding uncles singing to the beat.
            Kenneth regarded Phillip's pink eyebrows and curvaceous eyelashes. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied.
            Phillip glared. "Do you want me to shove that ripped book where the sun don't shine?"
            Kenneth promptly remembered his virtuous and controlling values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you."
            Phillip looked delighted, his wallet blushing like a splendid, selfish sandwich.
            Then Phillip came inside for a nice glass of port.
